/**
 * Root of the hierarchy of connector exceptions. This exception hierarchy aims
 * to let user code find and handle the kind of error encountered without
 * knowing the details of the particular API in use (e.g. JNDI, JDBC, etc).
 * 
 * As this class is a runtime exception, there is no need for user code to catch
 * it or subclasses if any error is to be considered fatal (the usual case).
